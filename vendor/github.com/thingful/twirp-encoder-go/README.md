# twirp-encoder-go

This repository contains autogenerated go Twirp stubs for the DECODE
`encoder` component. These stubs have been generated automatically from the
shared protobuf repo: https://github.com/thingful/decode-protorepo so these
files should not be edited directly.

## Making Changes

To make changes to the stubs, you must update the master protobuf definitions,
regenerate the client stubs and push the updated versions to the appropriate
repository. A script has been created within the master protorepo to automate
this process.
